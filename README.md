qb-paperwork is a lightweight QBox-compatible script that introduces a paperwork mode for police officers. While in paperwork mode, officers remain on duty and receive paychecks, but are excluded from duty-based script checks (e.g., for robberies or priority events).

This is ideal for situations where officers are handling investigations, reports, or jail processing without actively patrolling or responding to calls â€” helping balance server gameplay and ensuring fair crime scheduling.

Why Use It:

Keeps cops paid during non-patrol work

Balances robbery/event triggers by excluding passive officers

Simple /paperwork toggle command with automatic cleanup
