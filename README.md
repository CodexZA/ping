üìÅ qb-ping
Description:

qb-ping adds a /ping [id] command that allows players to share their live location with another player by placing a GPS blip on the map. It's a seamless way to meet up with friends, respond to calls, or direct people without needing to explain coordinates or street names.

Inspired by NoPixel's original mechanic, this script brings smooth, immersive player-to-player location sharing to your server.

Why Use It:

Enhances roleplay by simplifying location sharing

Police, EMS, or civilians can all use it to coordinate

Sends a map blip with auto-expiry and notifications

Zero reliance on third-party UI or complicated systems
